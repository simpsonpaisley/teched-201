## PNGs

### What is a PNG?

PNG stands for **Portable Network Graphic**.

The PNG format allows images to be highly compressed without losing any details. They can also contain 16 million different colours.

### When to Use a PNG?

PNGs are good for high-quality, detailed images, as they are a lossless file type, meaning they don't lose their data when compressed.

They are also good when you need an image with a transparent background.

PNGs are supported by all browsers, including older ones.

### Disadvantages of PNGs

Because PNGs are lossless, the files can be a lot larger than JPEGS or GIFS.
