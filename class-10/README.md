## Objects

A key and value pair is called a **property**.

To assign a variable to an object:

```html
objectName.keyName = variable;
```

Where `keyName` is the name you want the key to be, and `variable` is the variable you want the value to be.

---

A **Method** is a function inside an object.

To assign a method to an empty object, we can use the syntax:

```html
objectName.keyName = function() { // function script };
```

Where `keyName` is the name you want the key to be, and thus the name of the method, and **_the script inside the funtion_** is the value.

---

To access a method in an object, we can use the syntax;

```html
objectName.keyName();
```

This is because it is a funtion, and not a string.

If you _do_ use the parenthesis, it will run the function.

If you _don't_ use the parenthesis, it will just give the code from the function.
