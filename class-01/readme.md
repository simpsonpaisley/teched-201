## How the Internet Works

The internet is a network of optical fibre cables, which connect data centers with your devices.

Data centers contain SSD's which contain data.

Servers are computers which handle requests, providing the data you have requested.

This data then travels throught the cable network to your device.

Every device which is connected to the internet has an IP address. This is a unique identifier, which will be used to ensure the data you request is sent to the correct place. You can also access websites using the server's IP address.

Because IP addresses are hard to remember; domain names, such as youtube.com are used. These correspond with their IP address.

Servers can hold multiple websites, however, larger websites can use an entire data center to themselves.
